Scramjet for UNIX: Java acceleration for terminal apps
======================================================

This fully usable but still a work-in-progress.  I am adding new features and reorganizing old ones as I need them, according to how much free time I get to work on it.  --Jim

### Main applications

* __UNIX command-line tools:__ Scramjet allows fast UNIX-style command-line tools to be written in Java by avoiding the JVM startup time.
* __UNIX terminal applications:__ Scramjet allows writing efficient ncurses-style fullscreen Unicode ANSI text applications (editors, mail agents, viewers) in Java.
* __Eclipse hooks:__ Scramjet allows monolithic Java applications such as Eclipse to be controlled from the UNIX command-line, running commands on demand within the Eclipse JVM, with input/output via the terminal.
